# React Native Codemotion example

![WHOA](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/odino/react-native-codemotion/master/rn-codemotion.png?token=AAUC5NCtJ4cQgbRlVu6fLJhLm_ubTUEFks5W8YmqwA%3D%3D)

## Installation

* `make build` (this will take **a while**)
* start your emulator / connect your phone
* `make run`

## Why are the NPM modules pushed?

Just so that you dont run in any funny issue
when doing NPM install. I want to give a repo
that can work out of the box as much as possible.
